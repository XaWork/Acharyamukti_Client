    <string name="text_acharyamukti_long_text">Astrology is as old as is time, when a man on earth realized that events in his life are not happening the way they should or happening randomly, and following some particular pattern or cycle. Astrological predictions could be as basic as addressing personality traits, based out on the date of birth and sun sign to the most complex ones like predicting the destiny with aid from details like place, time, and date of birth. We all are interested in knowing what our future holds for us. There is hardly anyone who ignores the newspaper column every morning that forecasts the horoscope for the day. Many have such strong beliefs in astrology that they start their day, based on what the stars foretell for them. Looking at the present scenario and when technology has occupied every single aspect of our lives, astrology predictions have also become easy with online astrology consultation. Consulting an astrologer in the comfort of our surroundings and as per convenience is all the easier now.</string>
